# Organize document variables

In the properties panel, click the tool wrench.

![Variables](variables-1.png)

A panel will appear, where you can define/organize your document variables.

## Selecting

You can click to select / unselect a document variable.

With several document variables selected, you can [group](#group-variables) them.

See [Define Document Variables](/GraFx-Studio/guides/document-variables/define/) for the other options.

## Group document variables

You can put document variables into groups.

These groups can be used as a filter in the input form for the end-user. E.g. they can be presented as different steps the end-user needs to go through, with different input panels, each showing the document variables from a specific group.

It is possible to drag and drop one or more document variables in and out of groups and from one group to another.

## Ordering

You can drag and drop document variables in the list to change the order.

This is also the order in which they will be presented to the end-user.

It is possible to select multiple document variables and move them together in a group.

## Search

This will search on name and label.

Doing a search does not impact the list of document variables that is presented to the end-user. It's just a tool to make it easier to find your document variables.
